/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Prototyping.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset is in prototyping mode. It prioritizes developer speed and rapid iteration
 * by focusing on authorization and minimal data validation. Data shape validation is relaxed.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database has a flat structure with a top-level `work-orders` collection.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Listing of `work-orders` is denied.
