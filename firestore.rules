/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, with a hierarchy of owner -> admin -> employee.
 * All data is stored in top-level collections: /users, /clients, /masters, and /work-orders.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profiles in /users.
 * - Clients, Masters, and WorkOrders are owned by a user (ownerId field).
 * - Only the owner can create, update, or delete Clients, Masters, and WorkOrders.
 * - Public read access is enabled for Clients, Masters, and WorkOrders to facilitate prototyping.
 * - Data shape is not strictly enforced beyond ownership validation for prototyping flexibility.
